This is a one page application that interfaces with Google Vision AutoML and Bing Custom Search APIs. 

To run, simply clone and run "npm install" in nodejs. 

The image search function is unfortunately deprecated due to Google charging an arm and a leg to keep it going. You can tour the functionality though, and imagine how cool it would be. 😆 Backend code is at https://github.com/dbruner23/m2-backend

Main search-bar is a custom search setup with bing cloud service.
