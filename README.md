This is a frontend-only app that interfaces with two different search APIs. 

To run, simply clone and run "npm install" in nodejs. 

The image search function is unfortunately deprecated due to Google charging an arm and a leg to keep it going. You can tour the functionality though, and imagine how cool it would be 😆

Main search-bar is a custom search setup with bing cloud service.
